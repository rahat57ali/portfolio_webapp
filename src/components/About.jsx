      <p className="mb-4">As a backend developer, I'm fascinated by the challenges of creating scalable systems and handling data efficiently. I am passionate about applying my hands-on experience with <span rel="noreferrer" className="font-medium text-slate-200 ">Java</span>, <span rel="noreferrer" className="font-medium text-slate-200 ">C++</span>, and <span rel="noreferrer" className="font-medium text-slate-200 ">Node.js</span> to help build robust solutions. I'm eager to contribute to a fast-paced team and grow my skills in solving real-world backend challenges.</p>
